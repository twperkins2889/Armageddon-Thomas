1. Why each rule exists?

Each rule exists to let the app work and nothing more.

2. What would break if a rule was removed?

Either the app wouldn’t start, couldn’t reach the database, or couldn’t get the password.

3. Why broader access is forbidden?

Because giving extra access makes it easier for someone or something to cause damage.

4. Why this role exists?

So the EC2 server can securely talk to AWS services without hard-coding passwords.

5. Why it can read this secret?

Because the role is allowed to read the database password it needs.

6. Why it cannot read other secrets?

Because it was never given permission to read anything else.
